### 5. Build and Deployment Performance

- [ ] Optimize Vite build configuration
- [ ] Check for duplicate dependencies
- [ ] Verify proper tree-shaking implementation
- [ ] Test build times and optimize where possible
- [ ] Ensure efficient CI/CD pipeline

## Running a Complete Performance Audit

```bash
# 1. Run Lighthouse audit
npx lighthouse https://your-site.com --view

# 2. Analyze bundle size
npm run build
npx vite-bundle-visualizer

# 3. Check for performance issues in code
npx eslint . --ext .js,.ts,.svelte --config .eslintrc

# 4. Run Svelte compiler checks
npx svelte-check

# 5. Test with simulated throttling
# Use Chrome DevTools Network tab with throttling enabled
```

## Performance Optimization Workflow

1. **Measure**: Establish baseline performance metrics
2. **Analyze**: Identify bottlenecks and performance issues
3. **Optimize**: Implement targeted optimizations
4. **Validate**: Re-measure to confirm improvements
5. **Monitor**: Set up ongoing performance monitoring

## SvelteKit Rendering and Caching Strategies

### 1. Static Site Generation (SSG)

- [ ] Identify pages suitable for prerendering with `export const prerender = true`
- [ ] Implement static site generation for content-heavy pages
- [ ] Test build time and optimize for large static sites
- [ ] Use `export const entries = [...]` for dynamic route prerendering
- [ ] Implement proper cache invalidation for static assets
- [ ] Test performance differences between static and server-rendered pages
- [ ] Optimize static asset delivery through Cloudflare's CDN

### 2. Hybrid Rendering

- [ ] Implement hybrid rendering strategy (static + dynamic)
- [ ] Use `export const prerender = 'auto'` for intelligent prerendering
- [ ] Identify which routes benefit from static vs. dynamic rendering
- [ ] Test performance impact of hybrid rendering approaches
- [ ] Implement proper cache strategies for hybrid pages
- [ ] Use incremental static regeneration where appropriate
- [ ] Optimize the balance between build time and runtime performance

### 3. Server Rendering Optimization

- [ ] Implement and test proper SSR (Server-Side Rendering) for initial page loads
- [ ] Use `+page.server.js` for server-only code to reduce client bundle size
- [ ] Implement proper hydration strategies to minimize client-side JavaScript
- [ ] Test and optimize Time to First Byte (TTFB) for server-rendered pages
- [ ] Use streaming SSR for large pages with complex data requirements
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries to prevent SSR failures
- [ ] Test SSR performance with different data loading strategies

### 4. Caching Strategies

- [ ] Implement proper HTTP caching headers for static assets
- [ ] Use SvelteKit's `cache` option in page load functions
- [ ] Implement stale-while-revalidate caching patterns where appropriate
- [ ] Use Cloudflare's edge caching for optimal performance
- [ ] Implement proper cache invalidation strategies
- [ ] Test cache hit ratios and optimize as needed
- [ ] Use service workers for offline caching where appropriate

### 5. Preloading and Prefetching

- [ ] Implement proper preloading of critical resources
- [ ] Use SvelteKit's data preloading for anticipated user journeys
- [ ] Implement link prefetching for common navigation paths
- [ ] Test and optimize preload strategies to avoid unnecessary requests
- [ ] Use `<link rel="modulepreload">` for critical JavaScript modules

### 6. Partial Hydration and Islands Architecture

- [ ] Implement partial hydration for interactive components
- [ ] Use islands architecture for isolated interactive areas
- [ ] Test and compare performance between full and partial hydration
- [ ] Optimize hydration timing for critical user interactions

## TailwindCSS v4 Optimization

- Use JIT mode for optimal CSS bundle size
- Purge unused styles in production builds
- Minimize use of custom CSS outside of Tailwind
- Leverage Tailwind's built-in performance optimizations

## Internationalization Performance

- Ensure proper code splitting of translation files with @inlang/paraglide-js
- Verify that only needed translations are loaded
- Test performance impact of language switching
