- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Ensure TLS 1.2+ for data in transit

### Password Security
- [ ] Use strong hashing algorithms (Oslo SHA-256 with salt, bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2)
- [ ] Implement proper salt generation and storage (Oslo crypto utilities)
- [ ] Never store passwords in plain text or reversible encryption
- [ ] Avoid password hints or security questions

### Key & Secret Management
- [ ] Store secrets in environment variables, not code
- [ ] Rotate cryptographic keys regularly
- [ ] Use different keys for different environments
- [ ] Implement secure key derivation functions
- [ ] Never log or expose cryptographic keys

---

## 5. Session & State Management

### Cookie Security
- [ ] Set HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access
- [ ] Set Secure flag to ensure HTTPS-only transmission
- [ ] Configure appropriate SameSite attribute
- [ ] Set reasonable expiration times
- [ ] Implement secure session ID generation

### Session Management
- [ ] Generate new session IDs on login
- [ ] Invalidate sessions on logout
- [ ] Implement session timeout
- [ ] Prevent session fixation attacks
- [ ] Store minimal data in sessions

---

## 6. Dependency & Third-Party Security

### Package Security
- [ ] Run `npm audit` regularly
