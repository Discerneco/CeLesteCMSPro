## Running a Complete Security Audit

```bash
# 1. Run dependency vulnerability check
npm audit

# 2. Run static code analysis
npm run lint

# 3. Check for environment variable exposure
grep -r "process.env" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.svelte" src/

# 4. Run OWASP ZAP scan against development environment
# (Requires OWASP ZAP to be installed)

# 5. Check for security headers
curl -I https://your-site.com | grep -E 'Strict-Transport-Security|Content-Security-Policy|X-Content-Type-Options|X-Frame-Options|X-XSS-Protection'

# 6. Run npm audit for production dependencies only
npm audit --production

# 7. Check for exposed secrets in git history
# (Requires git-secrets to be installed)
git secrets --scan

# 8. Check for GDPR compliance in cookies
curl -s -I https://your-site.com | grep -i cookie

# 9. Test SSL/TLS configuration
# (Requires testssl.sh to be installed)
testssl.sh https://your-site.com

# 10. Check for sensitive data exposure in local storage
# (Manual check in browser DevTools)
```
