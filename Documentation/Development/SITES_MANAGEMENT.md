# Sites Management System

## Overview

CeLesteCMS Pro features a revolutionary multi-site management system that allows users to manage multiple websites from a single admin interface. Each site operates independently with its own content, templates, and configuration while sharing the same admin framework.

## Architecture

### Multi-Site Database Design
- **Sites Table**: Core site configuration (id, name, slug, settings)
- **Content Isolation**: Each site's content is logically separated
- **Shared Resources**: Users, media, and templates can be shared across sites
- **Independent Configuration**: Each site has its own settings and template assignments

### Site Slug System
- **Unique Identifiers**: Each site has a unique slug for URL routing
- **Preview URLs**: Sites accessible at `/preview/{site-slug}/`
- **Build Management**: Individual build directories per site
- **Performance**: Static file serving with proper caching per site

## Admin Interface

### Sites Management (`/admin/sites`)
- **Site Listing**: Overview of all managed sites
- **Quick Actions**: Create, edit, delete, and preview sites
- **Status Indicators**: Build status, last updated, preview availability
- **Bulk Operations**: Manage multiple sites efficiently

### Site Configuration
- **Basic Settings**: Site name, description, domain configuration
- **Template Assignment**: Link sites to specific Horizonte templates
- **Build Settings**: Generation preferences and deployment options
- **Performance Settings**: Caching rules and optimization preferences

## Site Generation Process

### Build System
1. **Content Compilation**: Gather site-specific posts, pages, and media
2. **Template Processing**: Apply assigned Horizonte template
3. **Static Generation**: SvelteKit-based build process
4. **Asset Optimization**: Image processing and code splitting
5. **Deployment**: Static files ready for hosting

### Preview System
- **Instant Preview**: Live preview during development
- **Static File Serving**: Production-like performance
- **HTTP Caching**: Proper cache headers for optimal loading
- **URL Rewriting**: Proper link processing for preview context

## API Endpoints

### Sites API (`/api/sites`)
```typescript
GET    /api/sites           // List all sites
POST   /api/sites           // Create new site
GET    /api/sites/[id]      // Get site details
PUT    /api/sites/[id]      // Update site
DELETE /api/sites/[id]      // Delete site
POST   /api/sites/[id]/build // Trigger site build
```

### Site-Specific Content
- **Content Scoping**: API endpoints automatically filter by site context
- **Cross-Site References**: Controlled sharing of resources when needed
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient content management across sites

## Performance Optimization

### Static File Serving
- **Industry Standard**: Following Ghost, Jekyll, Astro patterns
- **HTTP Caching**: 5-minute HTML, 1-day asset caching
- **ETag Support**: Conditional requests with 304 responses
- **Response Times**: Optimized to 13-28ms average response time

### Build Optimization
- **Incremental Builds**: Only rebuild changed content
- **Asset Deduplication**: Shared assets across sites
- **Code Splitting**: Optimal bundle sizes per site
- **CDN Ready**: Static files optimized for global distribution

## Use Cases

### Agency Management
- **Client Sites**: Manage multiple client websites from single dashboard
- **Template Reuse**: Apply consistent branding across client sites  
- **Content Isolation**: Secure separation between different clients
- **Billing Integration**: Per-site usage tracking and billing

### Multi-Brand Companies
- **Brand Management**: Different websites for different product lines
- **Shared Resources**: Common assets and user management
- **Consistent Infrastructure**: Single deployment pipeline for all brands
- **Performance Monitoring**: Centralized analytics across all sites

### Development Workflows
- **Staging Sites**: Test changes before production deployment
- **Version Management**: Multiple versions of same site for A/B testing
- **Client Collaboration**: Shared preview URLs for client feedback
- **Deployment Automation**: Automated builds and deployments

## Security Considerations

### Site Isolation
- **Content Security**: Logical separation prevents cross-site data leakage
- **Access Control**: User permissions can be scoped per site
- **Build Security**: Isolated build environments prevent cross-contamination
- **Preview Security**: Secure preview URLs with proper access controls

### Performance Security
- **DDoS Protection**: Static file serving reduces attack surface
- **Cache Security**: Proper cache headers prevent information leakage
- **Asset Security**: Secure handling of media and static assets
- **Build Security**: Controlled build processes prevent malicious code injection

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Multi-Site Features
- **Site Templates**: Pre-built site configurations for rapid deployment
- **Cross-Site Analytics**: Unified analytics dashboard across all sites
- **Automated Backups**: Per-site backup and restore capabilities
- **Custom Domains**: Full domain management and SSL certificates

### Enterprise Features
- **Team Management**: Role-based access control per site
- **White Labeling**: Custom branding for agency deployments
- **API Extensions**: Site-specific API customizations
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Performance monitoring and alerting per site
