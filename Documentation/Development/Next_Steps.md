# CeLesteCMS Pro - Next Steps

This document outlines the upcoming development tasks for CeLesteCMS Pro after establishing the UI baseline from the Archive implementation.

## üìà Overall Progress Status

- ‚úÖ **Phase 1a: Database Foundation** - COMPLETE
- üéØ **Phase 1b: Authentication System** - IN PROGRESS
- ‚è≥ **Phase 1c: Content Management** - PENDING
- ‚è≥ **Phase 2: Advanced Features** - PLANNED

---

## Implementation Strategy

After considering the current state of the CeLesteCMS Pro project, the following order for implementation is recommended:

### ‚úÖ 1. Database Connection (COMPLETED)

**Status: COMPLETE** ‚úÖ

**What was accomplished:**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive schema defined for all core entities (users, posts, categories, tags, media, content types, sessions, settings)
- ‚úÖ Drizzle ORM fully configured with SQLite for local development
- ‚úÖ Cloudflare D1 compatibility ensured (production-ready)
- ‚úÖ Database migrations generated and applied
- ‚úÖ Sample data created and tested:
  - Admin user: `admin@example.com` / `password`
  - 3 sample posts (2 published, 1 draft, 1 featured)
  - Categories, content types, and proper relationships
- ‚úÖ Database connection verified via Drizzle Studio and SQLite CLI
- ‚úÖ All 10 tables with 74 columns, indexes, and foreign keys working perfectly

**Database is now fully functional and ready for authentication integration!**

### üéØ 2. Authentication System (CURRENT PRIORITY)

**Reasons to implement second:**
- Security should be in place before implementing content management features
- The login page UI already exists, it just needs to be connected to real authentication
- User management depends on having authentication working
- Role-based access control is essential for a CMS

**Implementation considerations:**
- Connect login form to database users
- Implement session management
- Add proper auth guards to routes (already partially implemented)
- Set up role-based permissions (admin, editor, etc.)

### 3. Content Pages (Third Priority)

**Reasons to implement third:**
- These depend on both database and authentication being functional
- Different content types (posts, users, media) share similar CRUD patterns
- With auth and DB in place, you can implement proper access controls
- These represent the core functionality of the CMS

**Implementation considerations:**
- Start with the most foundational content type (likely posts)
- Implement basic CRUD operations
- Add media management after posts (as posts may reference media)
- Implement user management last as it's more sensitive

## DaisyUI Implementation (Incremental Approach)

- [x] Create a DaisyUI implementation strategy document with detailed component conversion guidelines
- [x] Convert Button components to use DaisyUI classes and styling
- [x] Convert Card components (AuthCard, Card, StatCard) to DaisyUI equivalents
- [x] Update form elements (inputs, checkboxes, selects) to use DaisyUI styling
- [ ] Implement DaisyUI modals and dialogs for notifications and confirmations
- [x] Convert navigation components (Sidebar, Menu) to DaisyUI
- [x] Update status indicators and badges to use DaisyUI classes
- [ ] Implement DaisyUI tabs for tabbed interfaces in content management
- [x] Apply DaisyUI themes while maintaining current dark/light mode functionality
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for DaisyUI component compatibility

## Authentication System Enhancement

- [ ] Complete server-side logic for user authentication
- [ ] Implement session management for login persistence
- [ ] Add password reset functionality with email verification
- [ ] Build account management interface for users
- [ ] Implement role-based access control for different user types

- [ ] Add focus management for improved keyboard navigation
- [ ] Create accessibility testing procedures and documentation
- [ ] Implement right-to-left (RTL) language support
- [ ] Add language detection and auto-switching based on browser settings
- [ ] Create comprehensive localization documentation

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement code splitting for improved loading times
- [ ] Add service worker for offline capabilities
- [ ] Implement image optimization and lazy loading
- [ ] Add caching strategies for API responses
- [ ] Implement database query optimization
- [ ] Create performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Add bundle size monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Implement server-side rendering for initial page loads
- [ ] Add performance testing to CI/CD pipeline

This plan will be updated as tasks are completed and new requirements emerge.
