## Next Development Priorities

### 🎯 1. MVP Final Polish - Accelerated Timeline (CURRENT PRIORITY)

**Status Update**: Major acceleration achieved - core MVP components complete ahead of schedule!

#### ✅ **Completed Ahead of Schedule (August 28, 2025)**
**Pages Foundation**: Database table, API endpoints, admin interface complete ✅
**Sites Management**: Multi-site architecture with individual configuration ✅  
**Horizonte Template Core**: Complete template parser with `[section:variant,prop=value]` syntax ✅
**Performance Optimization**: Static file serving with industry-standard caching ✅

**🏗️ Public Site Architecture Strategy (Hybrid Approach)**
*Inspired by microfolio analysis - maintain admin flexibility while optimizing public performance*

- **Admin Interface**: Keep database-driven (current working approach) ✅
  - Settings remain in database for dynamic admin functionality  
  - User management, content editing stay as-is
  - Zero risk to existing working systems

- **Public Site Generation**: Apply optimizations for static performance 🎯
  - **Dynamic Route Discovery**: Auto-generate prerender entries from database
    ```javascript
    // svelte.config.js enhancement
    prerender: {
      entries: [
        '/', '/blog',                    // Static routes
        ...await getPostRoutes(),        // Dynamic: /blog/[slug] 
        ...await getPageRoutes()         // Dynamic: /[page-slug]
      ]
    }
    ```
  - **Public Site Config**: Fast-loading site metadata (title, description, nav)
  - **Static Generation**: Pre-render all public content for SEO and speed
  - **Hybrid Performance**: Database for admin, static files for visitors

**Implementation Notes:**
- Implement during public route creation (Week 2-3)
- No changes to existing admin functionality  
- Best of both worlds: admin flexibility + public performance
- Minimal risk, maximum optimization impact

#### 🎯 **Revised Timeline - Plugin System Focus (September 2025)**
