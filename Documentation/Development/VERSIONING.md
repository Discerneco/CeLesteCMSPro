# CeLesteCMS Pro Versioning Strategy

## Semantic Versioning

CeLesteCMS Pro follows a semantic versioning pattern (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) with the following interpretations:

- **MAJOR (x.0.0)**: Represents significant changes that may include API changes, major feature revisions, or architectural shifts
- **MINOR (0.x.0)**: Represents new features and functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- **PATCH (0.0.x)**: Represents bug fixes and minor improvements

## Development Stages

During pre-1.0 development, versions have specific meanings:

- **0.0.x**: Pre-alpha stage, core foundations being built
- **0.x.0**: Alpha stage with functional features but incomplete
- **1.0.0**: First stable release with complete primary feature set

## Current Version Breakdown

- **v0.0.1**: Initial SvelteKit project setup
- **v0.0.2**: Core technologies integration (Svelte 5, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI)
- **v0.0.3**: Database schema implementation (current stage)

## Planned Milestones

- **v0.0.4**: Database migrations and basic CRUD operations
- **v0.0.5**: Authentication system implementation
- **v0.0.6**: Admin UI scaffolding
- **v0.0.7**: Content management functionality
- **v0.0.8**: Theme system
- **v0.0.9**: Static site generation
- **v0.1.0**: First alpha with complete basic functionality
- **v0.2.0**: Beta with public-facing site templates
- **v0.3.0**: Beta with plugin system
- **v1.0.0**: Production-ready release

## Version Bumping Rules

1. **PATCH bumps (0.0.x → 0.0.x+1)**: Small bug fixes or minor enhancements that don't change the API
2. **MINOR bumps (0.x.y → 0.x+1.0)**: New features or significant improvements without breaking changes
3. **MAJOR bumps (x.y.z → x+1.0.0)**: Breaking changes to API or significant architectural changes

During pre-1.0 development, version 0.1.0 represents the first feature-complete alpha release.
