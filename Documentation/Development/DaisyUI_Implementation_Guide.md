## Introduction

DaisyUI extends Tailwind CSS by providing semantic class names for common UI components, reducing the number of utility classes needed while maintaining full customizability. For CeLesteCMS Pro, we'll leverage DaisyUI while preserving our existing design system.

**Benefits of Using DaisyUI:**
- Semantic class names like `btn`, `card`, `modal` replace dozens of utility classes
- Theme system with support for light/dark modes and custom themes
- Responsive components with consistent styling
- Fully customizable through Tailwind configuration

## Setup & Configuration

DaisyUI is already installed and configured in the project:

```bash
# DaisyUI is installed as a dev dependency
npm i -D daisyui@latest
```

The `tailwind.config.js` contains custom themes:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
export default {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,svelte,ts}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('daisyui'),
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
  ],
  daisyui: {
    themes: [
      "light",
      "dark",
      {
        celesteLight: {
          "primary": "#1d4ed8",
          "secondary": "#4f46e5",
          "accent": "#0ea5e9",
          "neutral": "#2a323c",
          "base-100": "#f3f4f6",
          "info": "#3abff8",
          "success": "#36d399",
          "warning": "#fbbd23",
          "error": "#f87272"
        },
        celesteDark: {
          "primary": "#3b82f6",
          "secondary": "#818cf8",
          "accent": "#38bdf8",
          "neutral": "#191D24",
          "base-100": "#1f2937",
          "info": "#60a5fa",
          "success": "#34d399",
          "warning": "#fbbf24",
          "error": "#ef4444"
        }
      }
    ],
    darkTheme: "celesteDark",
    base: true,
    styled: true,
    utils: true,
    rtl: false,
    logs: true
  }
}
```

## Component Conversion Guide

### General Principles

1. Replace custom Tailwind utility classes with DaisyUI semantic classes
2. Maintain component hierarchy as specified by DaisyUI
3. Preserve localization references
4. Keep the same visual appearance

### Custom Components to DaisyUI Equivalents

| Custom Component | DaisyUI Equivalent | Notes |
|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `AuthCard.svelte` | `card` class | Use `card-body`, `card-title`, `card-actions` |
| `Card.svelte` | `card` class | Replace custom card styling with DaisyUI's card component |
| `StatCard.svelte` | `stats` component | Use `stat`, `stat-title`, `stat-value`, `stat-desc` |
| Form inputs | `form-control` | Use with `label` and `input` |
| Custom buttons | `btn` classes | Use with modifiers like `btn-primary`, `btn-outline` |

## Theme System

DaisyUI provides a theme system that allows easy switching between light and dark modes or custom themes.

### Using Custom Themes

```svelte
<!-- Apply custom theme to container -->
<div data-theme="celesteLight">
  <!-- Content with celesteLight theme -->
</div>

<!-- Apply custom dark theme to container -->
<div data-theme="celesteDark">
  <!-- Content with celesteDark theme -->
</div>
```

### Theme Switching

Replace manual dark mode toggling with DaisyUI themes:

```svelte
<!-- Before -->
<div class={`container ${isDarkMode ? 'dark bg-gray-950' : 'bg-gray-100'}`}>

<!-- After -->
<div class="container" data-theme={isDarkMode ? 'celesteDark' : 'celesteLight'}>
```

## Dark Mode Implementation

DaisyUI simplifies dark mode by using the `data-theme` attribute:

```svelte
<script>
  // Using Svelte 5 runes
  let isDarkMode = $state(false);
  
  function toggleTheme() {
    isDarkMode = !isDarkMode;
    // Optional: Store preference in localStorage
    localStorage.setItem('theme', isDarkMode ? 'celesteDark' : 'celesteLight');
  }
  
  // Initialize theme from localStorage
  $effect(() => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
      isDarkMode = savedTheme === 'celesteDark';
    }
  });
</script>

<!-- Apply theme to the page -->
<div data-theme={isDarkMode ? 'celesteDark' : 'celesteLight'}>
  <!-- Content -->
  
  <!-- Theme toggle button -->
  <button class="btn" onclick={toggleTheme}>
    {#if isDarkMode}
      <Sun class="h-5 w-5" />
    {:else}
      <Moon class="h-5 w-5" />
    {/if}
  </button>
</div>
```

## Localization Integration

Keep existing localization while converting to DaisyUI:

```svelte
<!-- Before -->
<button class="custom-button-classes">
  {$messages.common.save}
</button>

<!-- After -->
<button class="btn btn-primary">
  {$messages.common.save}
</button>
```

## Component Templates

### Cards

```svelte
<!-- Basic Card -->
<div class="card bg-base-100 shadow-xl">
  <figure>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Card Image" />
  </figure>
  <div class="card-body">
    <h2 class="card-title">{$messages.card.title}</h2>
    <p>{$messages.card.description}</p>
    <div class="card-actions justify-end">
      <button class="btn btn-primary">{$messages.card.action}</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Buttons

```svelte
<!-- Primary Button -->
<button class="btn btn-primary">{$messages.common.save}</button>

<!-- Secondary Button -->
<button class="btn btn-secondary">{$messages.common.cancel}</button>

<!-- Outline Button -->
<button class="btn btn-outline">{$messages.common.back}</button>

<!-- Button with Icon -->
<button class="btn btn-primary">
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-6 w-6" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor">
    <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4.318 6.318a4.5 4.5 0 000 6.364L12 20.364l7.682-7.682a4.5 4.5 0 00-6.364-6.364L12 7.636l-1.318-1.318a4.5 4.5 0 00-6.364 0z" />
  </svg>
  {$messages.common.like}
</button>
```

### Form Controls

```svelte
<!-- Text Input -->
<div class="form-control w-full max-w-xs">
  <label class="label">
    <span class="label-text">{$messages.form.emailLabel}</span>
  </label>
  <input type="text" bind:value={email} placeholder="email@example.com" class="input input-bordered w-full max-w-xs" />
</div>

<!-- Password Input with Toggle -->
<div class="form-control w-full max-w-xs">
  <label class="label">
    <span class="label-text">{$messages.form.passwordLabel}</span>
  </label>
  <div class="relative">
    <input 
      type={showPassword ? 'text' : 'password'} 
      bind:value={password} 
      placeholder="••••••••" 
      class="input input-bordered w-full max-w-xs pr-10"
    />
    <button 
      type="button"
      onclick={togglePasswordVisibility}
      class="absolute right-2 top-1/2 transform -translate-y-1/2"
    >
      {#if showPassword}
        <EyeOff class="h-5 w-5" />
      {:else}
        <Eye class="h-5 w-5" />
      {/if}
    </button>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Checkbox -->
<div class="form-control">
  <label class="label cursor-pointer">
    <span class="label-text">{$messages.form.rememberMe}</span>
    <input type="checkbox" bind:checked={rememberMe} class="checkbox" />
  </label>
</div>
```

### Navigation

```svelte
<!-- Navbar -->
<div class="navbar bg-base-100">
  <div class="navbar-start">
    <div class="dropdown">
      <label tabindex="0" class="btn btn-ghost lg:hidden">
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-5 w-5" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor">

      </ul>
    </div>
    <a class="btn btn-ghost text-xl">CeLeste CMS</a>
  </div>
  <div class="navbar-center hidden lg:flex">
    <ul class="menu menu-horizontal px-1">

    <button class="btn" onclick={toggleTheme}>
      {#if isDarkMode}
        <Sun class="h-5 w-5" />
      {:else}
        <Moon class="h-5 w-5" />
      {/if}
    </button>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Sidebar -->
<div class="drawer lg:drawer-open">
  <input id="my-drawer-2" type="checkbox" class="drawer-toggle" />
  <div class="drawer-content flex flex-col">
    <!-- Page content here -->
    <label for="my-drawer-2" class="btn btn-primary drawer-button lg:hidden">Open drawer</label>
  </div> 
  <div class="drawer-side">
    <label for="my-drawer-2" class="drawer-overlay"></label> 
    <ul class="menu p-4 w-64 min-h-full bg-base-200 text-base-content">
      <li><a href="/admin">{$messages.sidebar.dashboard}</a></li>
      <li><a href="/admin/posts">{$messages.sidebar.posts}</a></li>
      <li><a href="/admin/pages">{$messages.sidebar.pages}</a></li>
      <li class="mt-auto"><a href="/admin/logout">{$messages.sidebar.logout}</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Stats

```svelte
<!-- Stats Card -->
<div class="stats shadow">
  <div class="stat">
    <div class="stat-figure text-primary">
      <Globe class="h-8 w-8" />
    </div>
    <div class="stat-title">{$messages.dashboard.stats.activeSites}</div>
    <div class="stat-value">3</div>
    <div class="stat-desc text-success">↗︎ +1 (30%)</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Alerts

```svelte
<!-- Error Alert -->
{#if error}
  <div class="alert alert-error">
    <AlertCircle class="h-6 w-6" />
    <span>{error}</span>
  </div>
{/if}

<!-- Success Alert -->
{#if success}
  <div class="alert alert-success">
    <CheckCircle class="h-6 w-6" />
    <span>{success}</span>
  </div>
{/if}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Component Hierarchy**: Follow DaisyUI's component hierarchy (parent-child relationships)
2. **Combine with Tailwind**: You can still use Tailwind utility classes alongside DaisyUI
3. **Theme Attributes**: Use `data-theme` to control theming instead of manual class toggling
4. **Keep Localization**: Preserve the existing localization system with `$messages`
5. **Buttons and Inputs**: Always use DaisyUI's button and form classes for consistent styling
6. **Responsive Design**: DaisyUI components are responsive by default
7. **Customize Sparingly**: Only customize components when necessary to match existing design

### Lessons from Custom Components

Our existing custom components (`AuthCard.svelte`, `Card.svelte`, etc.) implemented functionality that DaisyUI provides out of the box. When converting:

1. Study the original component's structure and styling
2. Find the equivalent DaisyUI component
3. Transfer any custom logic or event handlers
4. Preserve the component's API (props, events)
5. Maintain the same visual appearance

### Converting Dark Mode Logic

Instead of toggling dark mode classes manually:

```svelte
// Before
isDarkMode = !isDarkMode;
document.documentElement.classList.toggle('dark', isDarkMode);

// After with DaisyUI
isDarkMode = !isDarkMode;
// The data-theme attribute handles styling automatically
```

## Conclusion

This guide provides a foundation for integrating DaisyUI into CeLesteCMS Pro. By following these guidelines, we can leverage DaisyUI's convenient component classes while maintaining our existing design system and localization.

As we implement individual pages, we'll refine this guide with specific examples and best practices based on our experience.

Integrating DaisyUI in a Svelte 5 (Runes) Project – A Comprehensive Guide

Replacing custom Tailwind components with DaisyUI in a Svelte 5 project (using the new runes reactivity) can streamline your UI development without altering your app’s appearance or behavior. This guide evaluates DaisyUI’s compatibility with Svelte 5, how to customize DaisyUI components (like buttons, cards, stats, and forms) to match an existing Tailwind CSS 4 design, and best practices for theming, accessibility, and localization. Follow the structured tips below to ensure a smooth integration that preserves your exact styling and logic.

DaisyUI Compatibility with Svelte 5 and Runes

DaisyUI works seamlessly with Svelte 5, including projects using the new runes reactivity model. Because DaisyUI is purely a Tailwind CSS plugin (no runtime JS), it doesn’t conflict with Svelte’s compiler or reactivity system ￼. In fact, DaisyUI’s philosophy of “designing more with less code” complements Svelte’s lightweight, no-virtual-DOM approach ￼. Key points on compatibility:
	•	Scoped Styles: Svelte’s scoped CSS doesn’t interfere with DaisyUI classes. DaisyUI’s component classes (e.g. .btn, .card) are global utility classes. Use them directly in your Svelte components’ class attributes. There’s no need for special syntax – Svelte will include DaisyUI’s styles globally, and they apply as expected (DaisyUI’s site confirms “perfect compatibility” with Svelte’s styling system ￼).
	•	Runes Mode: Svelte 5’s runes mode primarily affects Svelte component syntax and reactivity. Since DaisyUI is not a Svelte component library but a CSS toolkit, you won’t encounter runes-specific issues. You can safely import and use DaisyUI’s CSS classes in runes-enabled components just as in Svelte 4.
	•	Tailwind 4 Support: If your project is on Tailwind CSS v4, ensure you use DaisyUI v5 (the latest) which is fully compatible with Tailwind 4 ￼. Earlier DaisyUI versions won’t work with Tailwind 4’s new engine. Upgrading to DaisyUI 5 alongside Tailwind 4 resolves all compatibility issues ￼.
	•	External UI Libraries: Note that some older Svelte component libraries need updates for runes mode ￼. DaisyUI requires no such updates – it’s just CSS classes, so you can integrate it without worrying about Svelte compiler compatibility.

Tip: Install DaisyUI as a dev dependency and add it as a Tailwind plugin in your tailwind.config.js. For Tailwind 4, DaisyUI now provides pure CSS themes, reducing dependencies and ensuring compatibility ￼. This setup yields zero runtime overhead in the browser while giving you a comprehensive UI toolkit ￼.

Customizing DaisyUI Components to Match Your Tailwind 4 Design

One of the biggest goals is to preserve the exact look and feel of your current custom components. DaisyUI’s predefined components (btn, card, stats, form-control, etc.) are highly customizable. You can tweak colors, sizing, borders, and more so that the DaisyUI versions are visually indistinguishable from your originals.

DaisyUI’s Theming System vs Utility Overrides

DaisyUI offers two main ways to adjust component styling:
	•	Theming (CSS Variables): DaisyUI’s classes derive their colors and some sizes from theme variables. You can define a custom theme that matches your project’s palette, fonts, and rounding. For example, you can create a theme that mirrors your current light/dark colors by overriding DaisyUI’s default theme values (primary, secondary, neutral, etc., as well as special variables like border-radius). In tailwind.config.js, extend DaisyUI’s built-in themes or define new ones with your exact colors:

// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  daisyui: {
    themes: [
      {
        // Customize DaisyUI's default light theme:
        light: {
          ...require('daisyui/src/theming/themes')['light'],
          'primary': '#123456',           // your primary color
          'primary-focus': '#0f2340',     // e.g. a darker variant
          'primary-content': '#ffffff',   // text color on primary
          // ... (override other color keys as needed)
          '--rounded-btn': '0.25rem'      // custom border radius for buttons
          // (you can override DaisyUI CSS variables like --rounded-btn here)
        }
      },
      {
        // Similarly, define a custom dark theme:
        dark: {
          ...require('daisyui/src/theming/themes')['dark'],
          'primary': '#123456',
          'primary-focus': '#0f2340',
          'primary-content': '#ffffff',
          '--rounded-btn': '0.25rem'
          // ...
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

In the above, we spread DaisyUI’s built-in light and dark themes then override specific values (colors, etc.) to match your design. DaisyUI will apply these values via CSS variables, ensuring components like buttons and cards use your colors. Even border radii can be adjusted this way: DaisyUI exposes tokens like --rounded-btn, --rounded-box, etc., for component corners ￼. By setting those, you ensure things like buttons and cards have the same sharp or rounded corners as your design. (The DaisyUI maintainer notes that “Border radius is already a CSS variable” and any theme can be customized in this manner ￼.)

	•	Utility Classes & @apply: You can also refine styling at the usage site with Tailwind utility classes or global CSS overrides:
	•	Tailwind Utilities: Simply add Tailwind classes alongside DaisyUI classes in your Svelte components. DaisyUI is built on Tailwind, so utilities will override or complement DaisyUI styles. For example, if DaisyUI’s .btn has slightly more rounding than you want, you could add rounded-none to remove it. Or if you need a specific padding, include px-6 py-2 on the element. This method is straightforward and often sufficient for one-off tweaks. Example:

<button class="btn rounded-none px-6 text-white bg-[#123456]">Log In</button>

Here, a DaisyUI button gets custom padding and background color via utility classes, ensuring it looks exactly like your old Tailwind-styled button.

	•	Global @apply Customization: For broader, consistent changes, DaisyUI allows using @apply to redefine component classes globally ￼. In your global CSS (e.g., app.postcss or similar), you can target DaisyUI component selectors. For example, to make all DaisyUI buttons fully rounded in your app, you could add:

@utility btn {
  @apply rounded-full;
}

This uses Tailwind’s @apply within DaisyUI’s utility plugin to globally apply rounded-full to the .btn class on build. You could likewise apply @apply text-xs to shrink all .card-title text, etc. Use this technique sparingly for global style changes.

Combining a custom theme with selective utility classes will usually achieve a pixel-perfect match to your current styles:

Component-Specific Notes and Caveats

Below are tips for each type of component you plan to replace, focusing on how to get the DaisyUI equivalent to match your existing Tailwind 4 design exactly.
	•	Buttons (<button class="btn">): DaisyUI buttons come with preset padding, font sizing, and colors based on the theme. To replicate your design:
	•	Set the DaisyUI theme’s primary (and other variants) to your brand colors so that classes like btn-primary use exactly those colors. If you prefer not to use DaisyUI’s color naming, you can just apply your own classes (as in the example above, using a custom bg-[#123456]).
	•	DaisyUI’s base .btn has default styling (some padding, a light neutral background in light theme). If your design had a different default style (e.g., a transparent button with border), use DaisyUI’s modifier classes like btn-outline or btn-ghost as needed, or override via utilities. For instance, btn-outline will give a bordered button style which you can combine with custom colors.
	•	Border Radius: Ensure the corner rounding matches – DaisyUI buttons use the --radius-field variable via the .rounded-field utility by default ￼. If your current buttons are square, apply rounded-none or set --rounded-btn: 0 in your theme. Conversely, if they are more rounded than DaisyUI’s default, set a larger value or add rounded-full class as needed ￼.
	•	Focus and Hover: DaisyUI includes focus and hover styles (e.g., a slight darkening or shadow). Verify these align with your design. You can override them by extending the theme’s primary-focus color (for hover states) or using custom CSS like [data-theme="mytheme"] .btn:focus { … } if needed ￼. In most cases, matching the colors in the theme config will automatically apply your desired hover/active styles.
	•	Cards (<div class="card"> container): DaisyUI’s card component is essentially a styled panel with a rounded corner and shadow by default, and it expects inner elements like .card-body, .card-title, etc. to structure content. To match your admin panel cards or login boxes:
	•	Use the same content structure but customize appearance: For background color, DaisyUI by default uses bg-base-100 (a white or light neutral) on cards ￼. Ensure your theme’s base-100 variable matches your page background or card background color. You can also manually add a utility class like bg-gray-50 or whatever color matches your card.
	•	DaisyUI cards apply --radius-box for rounding (since cards are considered “large components”) ￼. If your cards were square or had different radii, adjust this variable or add a utility (rounded-lg, etc.) on the card container.
	•	For shadows/borders: By default, <div class="card"> might not include a shadow unless you add shadow or shadow-sm class as shown in DaisyUI examples ￼. Add or remove the shadow class to match your design (if your current cards have no drop-shadow, omit it). DaisyUI doesn’t force a border by default; if your old design had borders on cards, simply add a Tailwind border class (e.g., border border-base-300) to the card container.
	•	DaisyUI provides utility classes for card layout, but these don’t affect style heavily. For instance, a card with an image uses a <figure> inside. You can structure the content however you need – DaisyUI’s styling is flexible. The main thing is to apply the .card class to the container and .card-body to the content section so internal spacing is applied similarly. Adjust spacing or text alignment with regular Tailwind classes if needed to mirror your original.
	•	Stats (<div class="stats"> component): The stats component is basically a container for statistic items, which DaisyUI styles as a responsive grid of blocks. Key customization points:
	•	Background & Container: A stats block often is presented similar to a card. By default, a <div class="stats"> will likely have a transparent or base background. To match existing styling, you might need to add bg-base-100 or another class if your current stat boxes have a filled background or card-like container. Also consider adding shadow if your design did.
	•	DaisyUI’s stat items (<div class="stat"> inside the container) have internal padding and use theme colors for titles/values. Make sure your theme’s neutral or text colors align with your design’s text colors for these. You can also individually style them: e.g., if your stats had custom colored numbers, you can add classes like text-primary on the .stat-value elements.
	•	The stats layout (horizontal vs vertical) can be controlled with DaisyUI’s classes stats-horizontal or stats-vertical ￼. Use these to replicate how your current stats are laid out (for example, if on mobile you want them stacked, DaisyUI’s default is horizontal on wide screens and it wraps; you can force vertical with stats-vertical).
	•	If DaisyUI’s spacing between stat items differs from yours, you can override it with utility classes on the container (e.g., add gap-4 for a wider gap). DaisyUI aims for sensible defaults, but these small tweaks ensure an exact match.
	•	Form controls (inputs, labels, etc. using .form-control and related classes): DaisyUI provides a set of form classes (e.g. .form-control as a wrapper, .input for text fields, .select, .checkbox, .label for labels, etc.) that are pre-styled. To maintain your form’s look:
	•	Inputs: If you previously styled inputs with Tailwind (borders, focus outlines, etc.), you can likely achieve the same by using DaisyUI’s classes plus utilities. For example, <input type="text" class="input input-bordered"> gives a basic bordered input. The border color and radius come from theme variables (--rounded-field and the neutral color). If your original design had a thicker border or different focus color, define those in your theme (e.g., set neutral or info color appropriately) or override with utilities (border-2, focus:border-red-500, etc. as needed).
	•	Labels: DaisyUI’s <label class="label"> and <span class="label-text"> help style form labels. These typically just adjust font-weight and spacing. Ensure these classes are used so your labels get the same spacing as before, or adjust with utilities if needed (e.g., text-sm if DaisyUI’s default label text is too large).
	•	Form Layout: The .form-control class on a container (often a <div>) simply adds consistent bottom margin and aligns label+input together. If your form items were spaced differently, you can override this margin via Tailwind (e.g., mb-6) on the container or adjust DaisyUI’s base form styling via CSS. In general, DaisyUI’s form controls are minimal and likely close to your custom styles, but double-check specifics like focus outlines, error state styling (DaisyUI has classes like input-error you can use for red borders, etc., or use your own if you had custom error styles).
	•	Buttons in forms: Use the DaisyUI button tips above for submit/login buttons. DaisyUI also has a .btn-block utility if your login button was full-width block, etc.

Caveat – Fine Details: While DaisyUI components cover most common UI elements, if you have very bespoke styles (for example, a gradient button, or an atypical form field), you may need to apply custom CSS. DaisyUI can handle gradients via Tailwind utilities or custom theme values, but it doesn’t include every possible style out of the box. Identify any visual detail that doesn’t match after initial integration and address it by either: (a) extending the theme (for colors, fonts, etc.), (b) adding Tailwind classes to the element, or (c) writing a small custom CSS rule targeting the DaisyUI class (scoped by data-theme if needed to avoid affecting other themes ￼). The Stack Overflow example above shows adding CSS under a specific theme to tweak .btn borders ￼ – use that pattern if DaisyUI falls short in any styling aspect.

Theming Integration with Svelte Stores (Dark/Light Mode Switching)

Your project already supports dark/light mode with a data-theme switcher, and Svelte’s reactivity (runes) will help tie it all together with DaisyUI’s theming system.

DaisyUI is built around a data-theme attribute on your HTML (or body) tag to apply themes ￼. Each theme defines CSS variables for colors, etc., and switching the attribute swaps the theme. Here’s how to integrate this with Svelte:
	•	Enable DaisyUI Themes: In your Tailwind config, list the themes you want to use. For example, if you created custom light and dark themes (as shown above), include them and mark one as default. For instance:

@plugin "daisyui" {
  themes: light --default, dark --prefersdark;
}

This configuration (if using DaisyUI’s CSS-in-JS plugin syntax in a PostCSS file or the JS equivalent in config) enables your two themes, making light the default and dark the preferred dark-mode theme ￼. The --prefersdark flag means if a user’s OS is in dark mode and no override is set, DaisyUI will automatically use the dark theme by default ￼.

	•	Svelte Store for Theme: Use a Svelte store (writable) to track the current theme name (e.g. 'light' or 'dark'). Whenever this store changes, update the data-theme attribute:

// themeStore.js
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';
export const theme = writable('light');

In your root component or layout (depending on SvelteKit/Svelte setup), subscribe to this store and apply the attribute:

<script>
  import { theme } from './themeStore.js';
  import { onMount } from 'svelte'; 
  // (in Svelte 5, you might use runes like: import { effect } from 'svelte';)
  
  onMount(() => {
    const unsubscribe = theme.subscribe(val => {
      document.documentElement.dataset.theme = val;
    });
    return unsubscribe;
  });
</script>

This ensures that whenever theme store changes, the <html> tag’s data-theme is updated (here we use document.documentElement which is the <html> element). If you prefer, you can also bind an attribute in Svelte’s JSX-like syntax (though binding to <html> directly might require using SvelteKit’s <svelte:head> or a trick in the layout). The script approach works well.

	•	Theme Toggle Logic: If you already have a toggle component that flips between light/dark, simply have it call theme.set('dark') or 'light' accordingly. DaisyUI will immediately apply the corresponding theme’s variables (thanks to the reactive data-theme attribute). Optionally, use DaisyUI’s own theme-change helper library ￼ which can automate storing the preference in localStorage and toggling classes. However, since you’re in Svelte, leveraging the store (with perhaps a localStorage sync in your script) is straightforward and avoids extra dependencies. You can even animate the theme switch by adding a brief CSS transition for colors if desired.
	•	Preserve Exact Styling in Themes: To guarantee the visuals remain identical, ensure your custom DaisyUI theme definitions for light/dark carry over all style differences you had. For instance, if your dark mode had slightly different spacing or fonts, you might need to account for that (DaisyUI’s theming primarily covers colors, but you could also write a [data-theme=dark] .some-class { ... } if truly needed for other differences). In most cases, color and maybe border styles are the main differences. DaisyUI’s dark theme will apply a different palette, but since you’ll override it with your own values, you can make your “dark” exactly the same as your old dark scheme.
	•	Verify All Components in Both Themes: After integration, toggle the theme store and check each component (buttons, cards, etc.) in light and dark. DaisyUI’s built-in dark theme ensures proper contrast (e.g., swapping to light text on dark backgrounds) as long as you set the variables correctly ￼. Make sure things like icons or images still look right on a dark background (this shouldn’t change from your old setup, but confirm any CSS filters or theme-specific images are handled).

Best Practice: Consider using CSS media query prefers-color-scheme to set an initial theme if no user preference is stored. DaisyUI can automate this if you use --prefersdark as shown (so dark mode is auto if OS is dark) ￼. You can still let users override via your toggle, updating the store. Also, wrap the theme change logic in a Svelte effect or onMount to avoid SSR mismatches (e.g., on the server, you might default to light to prevent flashing).

Accessibility and Localization Considerations

Maintaining accessibility (a11y) and localization (i18n) standards is crucial during this refactor. Fortunately, DaisyUI is designed with accessibility in mind and will not compromise your existing a11y or l10n features if used properly.
	•	Semantic HTML: DaisyUI strongly encourages using native HTML elements for UI components, which yields better accessibility out of the box. For example, a DaisyUI toggle switch is just a styled <input type="checkbox">, and a modal uses the native <dialog> element ￼. Continue to use semantic tags as you replace components:
	•	Use <button> for clickable buttons (with btn class), not a <div> or anchor without href. DaisyUI styling will apply but the element’s inherent a11y (keyboard focus, screenreader announcement) remains because it’s a real button. (DaisyUI does not rely on role="button" hacks – it uses actual buttons) ￼.
	•	Use form tags like <label> and <input> normally (DaisyUI’s classes enhance them but don’t change their structure). This means your forms will still be navigable and labeled correctly. Ensure each input has a label or aria-label as before; DaisyUI doesn’t add any interfering code that would break that.
	•	For any interactive components like dropdowns or modals: DaisyUI uses modern standards (e.g., the new Popover API for dropdowns in v5, and <dialog> for modals) to ensure proper focus trapping and aria attributes ￼. If your project had custom modals with manual aria setup, consider adopting DaisyUI’s approach for consistency. Otherwise, you can keep your logic and just apply DaisyUI classes to your modal markup (but double-check focus management).
	•	Color Contrast: DaisyUI’s default themes are tuned for contrast – all built-in color combinations pass WCAG contrast checks ￼. Since you’re matching an existing design, you should verify that your chosen colors are also accessible. DaisyUI provides *-content color variables (like primary-content is the text color for primary backgrounds) and expects you to use them in pairs. If you stick to using text-primary-content on a bg-primary button, for example, DaisyUI ensures that text is readable on that background ￼. In your custom theme, define these content colors appropriately (usually white or near-white for dark backgrounds, etc.). This way, your light and dark modes remain accessible by default.
	•	Keyboard Navigation and ARIA: Because DaisyUI components are mostly styled semantics, they typically don’t require extra ARIA attributes. However, if any DaisyUI component lacks something (for instance, DaisyUI’s menu list might need role="menu" or similar for context – check DaisyUI docs for any specific component guidelines), be prepared to add it. The community has been improving DaisyUI’s accessibility; for example, DaisyUI 5 removed the old disabled class in favor of proper disabled attributes on buttons ￼. This indicates a push towards using standard attributes that screenreaders recognize. Continue your practice of setting attributes like aria-disabled, aria-label, aria-current, etc., exactly as you did with custom components. Nothing in DaisyUI will prevent or override those.
	•	Localization & RTL Support: DaisyUI is fundamentally CSS, so it won’t interfere with text translation or formatting. Your Svelte localization (whether via i18n libraries or manual dictionaries) remains the source of text content. Just replace the classes, not the text nodes, and all your translations will still appear as before.
	•	If your app supports multiple languages including right-to-left (RTL) scripts (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.), DaisyUI has you covered. Starting in v4, DaisyUI shifted to logical CSS properties (margin-inline, etc.) instead of purely left-to-right CSS ￼. This means when you set dir="rtl" on your <html> or a container, DaisyUI components will automatically adjust (for example, cards will flip padding as appropriate). Test a few pages in RTL to ensure everything still looks correct. Because your custom Tailwind components might have needed manual RTL fixes, you may find DaisyUI’s approach requires fewer overrides. (If you had custom CSS for RTL, you might be able to remove some if DaisyUI covers it.)
	•	DaisyUI does not inject any text content, so there are no strings to translate. Components like pagination or date pickers (if you used them) might have labels, but DaisyUI doesn’t provide those – you would supply them, and thus you control localization. For instance, a DaisyUI pagination might use << and >> or actual text like “Previous” if you put it in the markup. Ensure you provide translations for any such text as you did before.
	•	Testing: After integrating DaisyUI, it’s wise to run accessibility tests (e.g., using browser a11y extensions or npm run check if you have linters). Watch for any new warnings. One known scenario is if you use DaisyUI’s components improperly, you might see warnings (for example, using href="#" on a DaisyUI .btn link without a proper button role could trigger a lint warning). The fix is to use proper elements or add role/aria as needed. A Reddit discussion notes that VSCode might show a11y warnings if DaisyUI classes are on non-semantic elements ￼ – the resolution is always to “assign the correct aria role for the element you are styling” (in other words, don’t let the styling dictate the element; choose the element based on semantics, then style with DaisyUI) ￼.

In summary, DaisyUI will not compromise your app’s accessibility or internationalization. By adhering to semantic markup and leveraging DaisyUI’s built-in a11y-friendly components, you may actually improve accessibility (for example, DaisyUI’s default modal using <dialog> ensures proper focus handling which you might not have had before). Likewise, its RTL support via logical properties means your localized layouts are more robust ￼.

Conclusion and Implementation Checklist

Integrating DaisyUI into Svelte 5 with runes can be done incrementally and safely. Here’s a final checklist of actionable steps and tips to guarantee the same visual result and behavior when replacing your custom Tailwind components:
	1.	Install & Configure: Add DaisyUI v5 to your project. Update your Tailwind config to include DaisyUI as a plugin and define your custom light/dark themes (matching all colors, and variables like border-radius, to your current design) ￼. Double-check that the theme names (light, dark, or custom names) align with how you’ll use data-theme values.
	2.	Replace Gradually: Swap out one component at a time:
	•	For a button component, replace its classes with btn and DaisyUI modifiers, set the appropriate theme color (or utility classes) to match its previous style, and verify on the UI. Pay attention to hover/focus states.
	•	For a card or panel, wrap content in a <div class="card"> and inner <div class="card-body">. Apply any extra classes (background, shadow, rounding) to make it identical to the original.
	•	For stats, use the DaisyUI structure (stats container and multiple stat items). Style them with theme colors or utilities to match your old dashboard stats appearance (e.g., if certain stats were highlighted, use text-accent or similar).
	•	For form controls, apply DaisyUI’s form classes (form-control, input, select, etc.) to your form elements. Ensure the spacing and sizing matches – add Tailwind utilities or adjust theme variables (like --rounded-field) if needed to replicate your form layout.
	3.	Theming & Reactivity: Implement the Svelte store and data-theme switching as described, or integrate DaisyUI’s theme-change script if preferred. Test toggling between light and dark: the UI should swap colors exactly as before. Because you set up custom themes, your dark mode via DaisyUI will use the same palette as your previous dark mode.
	4.	Validate Appearance: Meticulously compare the new DaisyUI-styled components against the old design (if possible, side-by-side or via screenshots). They should be visually identical. Tweak any mismatches immediately – DaisyUI allows fine control via utilities and custom CSS, so any discrepancy can be corrected either through theme config or small overrides. Common tiny differences might include font-weight or spacing; these are easily fixed with Tailwind classes (e.g., font-semibold, mt-2, etc. as needed on DaisyUI elements).
	5.	Test Functionality: All interactive behavior (toggles, form validation, button clicks) should remain unchanged, as you mostly changed classes, not underlying logic. Verify that event handlers and Svelte store updates still work. For example, if a login button had a click event bound, replacing its class with btn won’t affect the binding. Similarly, if you had dark-mode logic, now it should trigger DaisyUI theme change.
	6.	Accessibility Review: Use dev tools or accessibility linters to ensure your components have proper roles and labels after the swap. Check keyboard navigation (e.g., tab through a form or menu styled by DaisyUI) to confirm focus outlines are visible and order is correct. DaisyUI’s focus styles are generally clear, but ensure they meet your requirements or adjust them (you can customize focus ring color via Tailwind if needed).
	7.	Localization/RTL Testing: Switch the app to other languages, especially any RTL language if supported. DaisyUI’s logical styling should handle layout, but confirm that everything still looks right (no overlapping text, no misaligned icons). Also verify dynamic text still fits in components (e.g., if a translation is longer on a button, DaisyUI’s button will expand just like a normal button since it’s just CSS).

By following this guide, you can confidently integrate DaisyUI into your Svelte 5 project without any regressions in look or feel. DaisyUI’s component classes will make your codebase cleaner (no more huge Tailwind class strings) while preserving the exact UI through careful theme customization and utility use. The end result is a Svelte 5 app that benefits from DaisyUI’s ready-made components and theming, all while maintaining your established dark/light modes, accessibility standards, and localization support.
