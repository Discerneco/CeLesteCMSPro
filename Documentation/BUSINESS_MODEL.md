Market Strategy Benefits
This approach offers several advantages:

Lower Adoption Barrier: A fully-featured free version makes it easier for users to try and adopt
Larger User Base: More users means more potential customers for premium offerings
Community Growth: Open source projects with strong features attract developer contributions
Market Positioning: Competes directly with established platforms on features
Word-of-Mouth: Users are more likely to recommend a great free product

Implementation Considerations
To make this model work:

Plugin Architecture: Create a robust, well-documented plugin system
Theme Marketplace: Build infrastructure for theme distribution and payment
Quality Standards: Establish guidelines for premium themes and plugins
