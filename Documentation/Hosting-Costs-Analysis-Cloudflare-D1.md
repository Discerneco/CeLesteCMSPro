# CeLesteCMS Pro: Hosting Costs Analysis - Cloudflare D1 Strategy

## **Executive Summary**

**Decision**: Proceed with database-per-site architecture using Cloudflare D1 as the primary hosting platform. This approach prioritizes client cost-effectiveness while delivering enterprise-grade multisite isolation.

**Key Finding**: Cloudflare D1 is designed specifically for multi-tenant applications with per-tenant databases, making it the optimal choice for CeLesteCMS Pro's architecture.

---

## **Cloudflare D1 Detailed Analysis**

### **Platform Overview**
Cloudflare D1 is a natively serverless SQL database built on SQLite, specifically designed for applications that need multiple, smaller databases rather than one large shared database.

### **2024/2025 Pricing Structure**

#### **Free Tier (Until February 10, 2025)**
```yaml
Database Count: 10+ databases per account (legacy docs show "thousands")
Size per Database: 10 GB maximum per database
Query Limits: To be enforced from Feb 10, 2025
Storage: Based on actual usage, not database count
Cost: $0 (perfect for alpha/beta testing)
```

#### **Paid Plans (Post February 10, 2025)**
```yaml
Base Cost: $5/month (Workers Paid plan)
Database Count: Unlimited databases at no extra cost
Pricing Model: Pay only for queries and storage usage
Architecture: Specifically designed for "per-tenant" databases
Enterprise Support: Millions of databases per account supported
```

### **Perfect Fit for CeLesteCMS Pro**

#### **Multi-Tenant by Design**
Cloudflare D1 official documentation states:
> "D1 allows you to build applications with thousands of databases at no extra cost for isolating with multiple databases"
> "D1 is designed for horizontal scale out across multiple, smaller (10 GB) databases, such as per-user, per-tenant or per-entity databases"

This exactly matches CeLesteCMS Pro's database-per-site architecture.
