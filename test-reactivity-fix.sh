echo "🚀 Test sequence:"

echo "2. Visit: http://localhost:5173/admin/login"

echo ""
echo "🧪 Language switching test:"
echo "✅ Login page loads in English"
echo "✅ Click 'Português (BR)' → Content changes to Portuguese"
echo "✅ URL changes to /pt-br/admin/login"
echo "✅ Click 'English' → Content changes back to English"
echo "✅ URL changes to /admin/login"

echo ""
echo "🎯 Success indicators:"
echo "✅ No 'Cannot find module' errors"
echo "✅ Language switcher shows correct current language"

echo "3. Navigation preserves language selection"
echo "4. Debug panel shows synchronized state"
echo "5. Both login and dashboard are fully functional"

echo "2. Verify debug panel shows synced state"
echo "3. Ensure URL has correct language prefix"
echo "4. Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)"

echo ""
echo "🔧 To remove debug panel later:"
echo "Edit src/lib/components/LanguageSwitcher.svelte"
echo "Remove the debug panel div at the bottom"
