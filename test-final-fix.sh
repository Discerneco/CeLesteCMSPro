echo "🎉 LOCALIZATION FIX COMPLETE!"
echo "============================"

echo ""
echo "✅ What was fixed:"
echo "1. LanguageSwitcher simplified to trust Paraglide strategy system"
echo "2. Login page syntax corrected to use m['auth.key']() format"
echo "3. Debug panel added to track language switching"

echo ""
echo "🔧 Technical details:"
echo "- Problem: Paraglide compiled flat exports instead of nested objects"  
echo "- Solution: Updated syntax from m.auth.loginTitle() to m['auth.loginTitle']()"
echo "- Result: Messages will now load correctly in both languages"

echo ""
echo "🚀 Test instructions:"
echo "1. Run: pnpm dev"
echo "2. Visit: http://localhost:5173/admin/login"
echo "3. Look for:"
echo "   - Content loads in English by default"
echo "   - Language switcher shows 'English'"
echo "   - Debug panel shows current locale info"

echo ""
echo "4. Click the globe icon → Select 'Português (BR)'"
echo "5. Verify:"
echo "   - URL changes to /pt-br/admin/login"
echo "   - 'Login to your account' → 'Entre na sua conta'"
echo "   - 'Email' stays 'Email'"  
echo "   - 'Password' → 'Senha'"
echo "   - 'Login' button → 'Entrar'"
echo "   - 'Remember me' → 'Lembrar-me'"
echo "   - Language switcher shows 'Português (BR)'"

echo ""
echo "6. Navigate around (refresh, go to other pages)"
echo "7. Verify: Language persists across navigation"

echo ""
echo "🔍 Debug panel shows:"
echo "   Current: Component language state"
echo "   Runtime: Paraglide getLocale() result"  
echo "   Path: Current URL path"
echo "   Synced: ✅ if component and runtime match"

echo ""
echo "🎯 Success criteria:"
echo "✅ All form labels translate properly"
echo "✅ Language switcher shows correct current language"
echo "✅ URL routing includes /pt-br/ prefix for Portuguese"
echo "✅ Language persists across page refreshes"
echo "✅ Debug panel shows synchronized state"

echo ""
echo "🚨 If something doesn't work:"
echo "1. Check browser console for errors"
echo "2. Verify debug panel shows synced state"
echo "3. Ensure URL has correct /pt-br/ prefix"
echo "4. Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)"

echo ""
echo "🎉 Once verified working, you can:"
echo "1. Remove debug panel from LanguageSwitcher.svelte"
echo "2. Apply same m['key.path']() syntax to other pages" 
echo "3. Expand to more languages (Spanish, French, etc.)"

echo ""
echo "Ready to test! Run 'pnpm dev' and visit the login page."
